I am a Data Scientist on the Core Search and AI team at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about), working on improve people's search experiences with [Bing](https://www.bing.com/). Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience at [Duke University](https://dibs.duke.edu/centers/center-cognitive-neuroscience/) with Drs. Felipe De Brigard, Roberto Cabeza, and Simon W. Davis, studying the behavioral and neural attributes of human memory.
